        "Over the past decade a lot of frustration has been built up over an age-old practice of referral fees. Ambiguity and unreasonable fees for represented deals have put a wrench into what should be a wonderful process - getting a deal done. High fees are often added to deal modeling and can change or eliminate offers which is against our mission. Dozens of interviews with all types of buyers resulted in an agreement that 0.5% is a more than fair fee that will not change deal structure at all.

      answer: (
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <p>
            Over the past few years, mergers and acquisitions professionals have
            witnessed an unprecedented influx of search funds and
            entrepreneurship-through-acquisition (ETA) buyers entering the
            market. These are often first-time acquirers – MBA graduates, young
            professionals, or even social media-inspired entrepreneurs – seeking
            to buy and run a business. Many of these newcomers are
            underqualified "tire kickers" who struggle to close deals,
            especially those chasing the popularized idea of buying a business
            with "no money down." Deals get bogged down because of the need to
            qualify and quantify.

      answer:
        "The original CIM Amplify platform, launched in October 2024, quickly gained amazing traction with over $3 Billion in deals (none scraped), all with more than $1 Million in EBITDA. The original platform was a general posting site. We learned quickly that buyers don't have time to scroll deals and hate that a deal on our site may be on other sites. We also learned that most top Advisors have client requirements where they need to get buyers approved before approaching them - and open listings have the Tire-Kicker problem. We solved those issues and many more with this version launched in August 2025. TL:DR - No",
